## Hi there 👋

I’m @ChnjFan, a network protocol developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++ (C++17/20/23 standards), network protocol stacks (TCP/IP, UDP, gRPC), high-concurrency server development, and system performance optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning modern asynchronous programming with C++23 coroutines, eBPF-based network acceleration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source network projects—such as custom protocol design, Protobuf/JSON data encoding optimization, or high-performance RPC framework development. Also open to joint efforts on IoT protocol implementations (MQTT/CoAP) or low-latency communication systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect via GitHub (@ChnjFan) or send an email to [chnj_lf@163.com]. Feel free to DM me for technical discussions on network programming!
